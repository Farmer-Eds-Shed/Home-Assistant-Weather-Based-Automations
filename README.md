# Home-Assistant-Weather-Based-Automations
Even though there is already an OpenWeatherMap integration for Home Assistant it lacks some features that were required for predicting cloud cover over the course of a day.<br />

An API is available, it requires a subscription but it is free. https://openweathermap.org/api , https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api <br />

It uses a Json format which can be read by Home Assistant's Rest https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest <br />

A useful tool for finding json paths is https://jsonpathfinder.com/ <br />
